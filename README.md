# Unexpected behavior of Tailwind directives in React

This repository demonstrates an issue where Tailwind CSS directives don't seem to apply correctly in a React component.  The expected background color is not rendered.

## Bug Description
The `bg-red-500` class should set the background color to red. However, the component renders without the expected styling.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly interpreted by including the correct Tailwind directives or using a build process.  For this specific issue, a missing configuration file or build step might cause this problem.
